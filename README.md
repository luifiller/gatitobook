# GatitoBook

This project is the result of learning from [Alura's Angular course](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/angular-boas-praticas-arquiteturas-formularios) and was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.1.

Objectively, this project is a social network for posting pictures of cats (gatitos), in which you can comment and react to these posts.

## Authentication API

Before running a development server, you should navigate to the `api-forms-main/api` directory and run `npm start` (it is recommended to do this procedure in another terminal).

After the API is working, you can proceed to the step of running/creating a development server.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help
